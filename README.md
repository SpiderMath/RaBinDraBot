## Hosting the Bot
- Rename .env.example to .env<br/>
- Fill the proper info in .env<br/>
- Replace Util/Client/mongodbUris.json with your OWN URIS and Util/Client/emojis.json with your own emojis<br/>
- Run `npm install` to install all the required Dependencies<br/>
- Run `node .` to run the bot<br/>
- If any problems, fix it yourself, don't ask me to help since this bot is my own personal project and I didn't ask you people to copy it lol. Thus I'm not responsible for any errors
